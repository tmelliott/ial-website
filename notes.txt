# 17.12.2025

Tom + Matt discussion about final changes before launch (planned for early Jan 2026).

- colour gradient - much dimmer 'red' colour

- landing:
    - make the hero 'footer' bit stand out
    - Meet the team doesn't work -> about#team
    - collaborators: blink through pages of icons (if more than one page)
    - data section: not working mobile?
    - apps - autoscroll if mouse isn't over
    - Tye out data apps ... typo

- about page:
    - team: 2 then 4 columns (no staggering)
    - copy "Horizon Europe" from landing page, under "View our work"

- projects page:
    - standout

- apps page:
    - show logo (if exists) on top of banner
    - editable text needs to be editable (at end)

- keywords page(s):
    - editable link (Custom)
    - add optional blurb of text
